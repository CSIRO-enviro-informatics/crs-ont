An item may be stored and retrieved in an electronic recordkeeping system, but will still have the descriptive attributes of items that exist in a hard-copy form.

  * result from the same accumulation or filing process and are of similar function, format or informational content.

Similarity of format is secondary to the accumulation process, as the same accumulation or system of arrangement and control can produce unique electronic and paper-based records.

For control system purposes, a series may consist of a single item, eg a diary, register or file, if it is one of a kind.

Each series is identified by a control number, eg

  A461, Correspondence files, multiple number series (third system), 1934-1950

  A29, Copies of speeches made by the Governor-General to Parliament, 1902-1917

  AWM31, Troopship passenger lists, 1915-1920

  J164, Quarantine roster, 1920-1937

The term `series' is also used loosely within the Archives to refer to collective units of description brought together under fundamentally different arrangement and control criteria, eg former Accession System series and unserialised accessions. The type of `series' under consideration can be distinguished by the types of archival control numbers, codes and descriptive information present. These distinctions and their underlying meanings will not be readily apparent to agency staff, public users and others who are unfamiliar with the Archives' control systems."""@en ;
